Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by Holberton School. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

0x00. C - Hello, World
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
more projects are coming soon!!
I am on my way to be the best software engineer that I can possibly be!!
